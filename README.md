## Ports for constructing the 'base'  collections from the 'current-systemd' branch of version of NuTyX

Contributions are welcome. If you don't know what it all about, please take the time to read the documentation at
http://www.nutyx.org/en/build-package.html
(version franÃ§aise)

It will explain you what's a collection, a git, a port, the tools around 'cards' etc
### Introduction
How does this works ? This git contains the "base" collections. 

### How does this works:
First we get the current git of nutyx localy (step1) as normal user. As we want to install a NuTyX base system in a local directory, we need to become root admin. Before installing the NuTyX in a chroot, we adjust some configuration files (step 2) so that the install-nutyx script pickup them during the installation (step 3). Once the chroot is in place, we want to make the git current project visible into the chroot (step 4 and 5). Now we are ready to start, so we can enter into the chroot (step 6). As we installed a minimal set of packages, we first need to install the 'devel' packages and some extra tools (step 6 and 7). One this is done, we have 2 choices. Either we synchronise ALL the existing binaries, means we just want to update a few packages (case 1). Either we want to build ALL the binaries ourself (case 2). So Case 1, we should use option -s and for case 2 it will be -a
### How to test this git:

#### 1. Clone it in your home directory

    $ cd
    $ git clone https://github.com/fanch/current.git
	
#### 2. Become root until the end, define and create the directory used by the scripts:

 The script is checking the files /etc/install-nutyx.conf and /etc/install-nutyx.conf.d/cards.conf if they exist, if yes it will use them, so:

    $ su -
    # echo "LFS=/mnt/lfs
    DEPOT=/current
    VERSION=current" > /etc/install-nutyx.conf
    # mkdir -p /etc/install-nutyx.conf.d
    # cat > /etc/install-nutyx.conf.d/cards.conf << "EOF"
    dir /current/base|http://127.0.0.1
    base /current/base
    logdir /var/log/pkgbuild
    EOF
 We need to have a correct pkgmk.conf file as well so, lets create it:

    # cat > /etc/install-nutyx.conf.d/pkgmk.conf << "EOF"
    export CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe"
    export CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"
    case ${PKGMK_ARCH} in
        "x86_64"|"")
            export MAKEFLAGS="-j4"
            ;;
        "i686")
            export CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -m32"
            export CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -m32"
            export LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -m32"
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Unknown architecture selected! Exiting."
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
    PKGMK_GROUPS=(devel man doc service)
    PKGMK_LOCALES=(fr de it es nl pt da nn sv fi)
    PKGMK_CLEAN="no"
    PKGMK_KEEP_SOURCES="yes"
    PKGMK_SOURCE_DIR="/tmp"
    PKGMK_WORK_DIR="/tmp/work"
    PKGMK_COMPRESS_PACKAGE="yes"
    PKGMK_COMPRESSION_MODE="xz"
    PKGMK_IGNORE_REPO="no"
    PKGMK_IGNORE_COLLECTION="no"
    PKGMK_IGNORE_RUNTIMEDEPS="no"
    EOF


#### 3. Install a base NuTyX system (assume below the user is 'lfs' so adapt to yours)

    # bash /home/nutyx/current/scripts/install-nutyx

#### 4. In your chroot Make the directory where the git copy will comes

    # mkdir -v /mnt/lfs/root/current

#### 5. Mount your git project (assume below the user is 'lfs' so adapt to yours)

    # mount -o bind /home/nutyx/current /mnt/lfs/root/current
	
#### 6. Enter now in your chroot (assume below the user is 'lfs' so adapt to yours)

    # bash /home/nutyx/current/scripts/install-nutyx -ec

#### 7. Prepare the first execution of the build script

    # get cards.devel wget vim rsync git tar
 
#### 8. If everything is OK, synchronize the current 'base' collections binaries

    # cd /root/current
    # bash scripts/base -l

#### 9. If everything is OK, check with cards level what's new

    # cards level

 It should shows all the packages available.

#### 10. If you want to re build completly 'base' collection from the sources 

    # bash scripts/base -a


Have fun :)

# current-systemd
